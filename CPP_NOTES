PROBLEMS TO BE REVISED BEFORE INTERVIEW
        MERGE 2 SORTED ARRRAYS.
        Median Of 2 Sorted Arrays.
        Infix -> Postfix (Reading algo is must,,,coding is not must but,, just see how we have made the function of handling the operator);
        Infix -> Prefix (Read the algo from gfg carefully);
        Evaluvation of the postfix expression
        Swap atmax k zeroes to make longest consecutive 1's -> Donot check gfg solution for that,,,watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaVTOazeb4
                        Also do see how do we handle the 2 pointer problems.
